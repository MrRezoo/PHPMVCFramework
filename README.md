## General info

We started the project on April 17th, In order to find a new path for how to code pure.

If today it is very easy to build a platform with advanced frameworks, but unfortunately we do not know the story behind it.

Now that we have this opportunity, we have implemented all the basic concepts including web development protocols, framework development structure and design templates to implement the best practice with PHP.

Items that have been considered in this project:
- Use design pattern >> ex:singleton(abstract)
- protocol web >> exception handling
- section handling >> ex:flash session
- query handling >> orm(find_one)
- Routing for url
- template engine >> for handler >> input handler
- onion middlewares >> isguest
